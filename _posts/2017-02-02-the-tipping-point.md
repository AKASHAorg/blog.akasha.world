The last couple of weeks have been (very) intense and filled with excitement. After an [amazing alpha public release](http://blog.akasha.world/2017/01/16/into-the-ether/){:target="_blank"} we have been busy applying the lessons learned, fixing bugs and implementing new features. Many thanks, again, to everyone for the warm welcome and kind words following the first alpha versions!

Today, as a token of appreciation, we bring to you *The Tipping Point* - the latest AKASHA release. 

*The Tipping Point* (0.4.0) includes numerous bug fixes and improvements while also introducing new features such as:

* Gas abstraction for most interactions (WIP)

Those who have tried AKASHA before  will notice an overall improvement compared the first release(s). 

The streamlined UX and various optimizations make *The Tipping Point* feel like a solid step forward. Gas abstraction is something we'll have to work on a bit more, but you can already feel the difference :) 

But enough said, it's even better to experience it yourself:

As a word of caution, since it is an alpha, this dapp comes with all the instability associated with early experiments - just as the first flight attempts were not necessarily safe or comfortable. 

Failures, glitches and random errors **should be expected**. In case you stumble upon something that doesn't work as it should, [please open an issue](https://github.com/AkashaProject/Alpha/issues/new){:target="_blank"} and we’ll look into it as soon as possible. 

Remember that we’re just getting started - things should get better with each release.
