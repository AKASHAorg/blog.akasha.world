Hello again everyone! Today we bring you a brand new AKASHA release named *Seeking Whispers*. The latest 0.5 version contains multiple bug fixes and introduces new features such as Whisper based searching, easy identity backup, mentions and…*drums in the background*…GIF support!

Among the bugs fixed we also squashed the famous *“link of death”* bug which was stopping users from publishing and saving drafts containing embedded links (sorry about that one -_-;)

The spotlight of this release revolves around the Whisper search experiment since it enables truly private searches by not revealing the identity of the person making the request. As far as I am aware we might be the first ones using Whisper for this purpose and so far it seems like there's real potential here - big kudos go to Marius for the idea and implementation. 

Following the initial results of this searching experiment we plan to implement it also for people and the rest of the sections that will be rolled out in the near-mid future.

Another highlight comes from the **over 1000 entries published** in a completely decentralized fashion using smart contracts/IPFS, and we are rapidly approaching 2000 identities created on AKASHA. Yaaay! On this note, the first user from Kenya joined us a couple of days ago and we are looking forward to the moment where the project turns into a global movement. 

All in all, it seems that we are gaining momentum and it *still* feels like we’re only getting started.

That being said, after this release we want to focus on refactoring the code, preparing things in the meantime for the moment in which we will open source AKASHA. Expect a slow down in the next month or two when it comes to new features - but it will definitely be worth it in the long run. Thank you for your understanding! ^_^

Bellow you can find a few screenshots exemplifying the features:

Just as with the last releases, the general rule of thumb for is `“If something breaks, refresh the dapp.”` Since it is an alpha, it comes with all the instability associated with early experiments - just as the first flight attempts were not necessarily safe or comfortable. 

Failures, glitches and random errors should be expected. In case you stumble upon one, [please open an issue](https://github.com/AkashaProject/Alpha/issues) on our GitHub repo and we’ll look into it as soon as possible. 

We’re looking forward to hearing your thoughts and we hope you will enjoy this release!

PS: This is a short video covering what happened “in the meantime” while development was taking place since AKASHA was part of the EDCON event organized in Paris. The full recorded talk will follow soon :)
