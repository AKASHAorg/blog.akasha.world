Hello everyone, during the last couple of weeks we have been busy applying the lessons learned from the first releases, fixing bugs and implemented new features.

Many thanks, again, to everyone for your support and kind words following the first alpha versions! As a token of our deep appreciation we bring to you *The Tipping Point*.

The latest release (0.4.0) includes numerous bug fixes and improvements while also introducing new features such as:

* Tipping

* A new stream view for displaying recent posts across the AKASHA network, regardless of tags
* Comment threading and replies 
* New comments notification while navigating the discussion 
* Whisper Chatrooms
* Profile hover card for easy access to actions such as “follow” and “send tip” for entries, chat and comments
* Gas abstraction for most interactions (WIP)

As a word of caution, since it is an alpha, this dapp comes with all the instability associated with early experiments - just as the first flight attempts were not necessarily safe or comfortable. 

Failures, glitches and random errors **should be expected**. In case you stumble upon one, [please open an issue](https://github.com/AkashaProject/Alpha/issues/new){:target="_blank"} and we’ll look into it as soon as possible. Remember that we’re just getting started - things should get better with each release.

Let's explore together what lies beyond The Tipping Point.
