Hello everyone, during the last couple of weeks we have been busy applying the lessons learned from the first releases, fixing bugs and implemented new features. Many thanks, again, to everyone for your support and kind words following the first alpha versions!

As a word of caution, since it is an alpha, it comes with all the instability associated with early experiments - just as the first flight attempts were not necessarily safe or comfortable. 

Failures, glitches and random errors **should be expected**. In case you stumble upon one, [please open an issue](https://github.com/AkashaProject/Alpha/issues/new){:target="_blank"} on our GitHub repo and we’ll look into it as soon as possible. 

That being said, remember that we’re just getting started - things should get better with each release.

Let's explore together what lies beyond The Tipping Point.
