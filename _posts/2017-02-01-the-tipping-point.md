Hello everyone, during the last couple of weeks we have been busy applying the lessons learned from the first releases, fixing bugs and implementing new features. Many thanks, again, to everyone for your support and kind words following the first alpha versions! 

As a token of appreciation we bring to you *The Tipping Point*, the latest release (0.4.0). 

*The Tipping Point* includes numerous bug fixes and improvements while also introducing new features such as:

As a word of caution, since it is an alpha, this dapp comes with all the instability associated with early experiments - just as the first flight attempts were not necessarily safe or comfortable. 

Failures, glitches and random errors **should be expected**. In case you stumble upon one, [please open an issue](https://github.com/AkashaProject/Alpha/issues/new){:target="_blank"} and we’ll look into it as soon as possible. Remember that we’re just getting started - things should get better with each release.

What lies beyond [*The Tipping Point*](https://github.com/AkashaProject/Alpha/releases/tag/0.4.0)?
