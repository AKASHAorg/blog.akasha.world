Hello everyone, I bring good news: **the pre-alpha version of [AKASHA](http://akasha.world/){:target="_blank"} will be launched in October!**

When the time comes, the invites will be delivered to your inbox and will include installation details which should make the entire setup process a breeze. However, if you encounter any problems, feel free to [join our slack](http://akasha-slack.herokuapp.com/){:target="_blank"} - we are friendly people :)

During the first rollout, we plan to test the basic core features such as creating an identity, following a person, publishing an entry, commenting, bookmarking, voting, following a tag, creating a tag and so on.

Depending on our findings in the next few weeks we will test the rest of the functionality in anticipation of the public alpha release. 

One step at a time.

You can find bellow an overview of the direction we are foreseeing in the near future as a *tentative*, high-level, loosey-goosey roadmap for the main network launch, with the mention that things will most likely evolve depending on our findings. 

### This is a marathon, not a sprint

![Stargate Blueprint]({{ site.baseurl }}/content/images/stargate-blueprint.jpg)

**Stage 0 (October 2016)**

*Invitations gradually sent to ~4500 users*

Invitation based access for the early [alpha subscribers](http://akasha.world/){:target="_blank"} using an Ethereum test chain.

Main goals

- Test the dapp on the major operating systems
- Observe the smart contracts and dapp components interaction
- Identify potential flaws in the system design
- Fix major bugs & issues uncovered before the public alpha

**Stage 1 (Q4 2016)**

*Public alpha release*

Debut with brainstorming challenge for ideas and features in the next releases.

Main goals

- Signal that AKASHA is a community driven project
- Tap into the collective intelligence of the community
- Collect and incorporate feedback from the users
- Token economy challenge launched for proposals that would creatively reward participants on AKASHA

**Stage 2 (TBD)**

*Core smart contracts breakathon*

Open source the smart contracts powering AKASHA, followed by breakathon event with prizes for anyone able to exploit or break the smart contracts. Breakathon will be extended to the token contracts proposed in the next stage. Actively experiment with solutions for displaying content published inside the dapp in normal Web 2.0 browsers.

Main goals

- Smart contracts crowdsourced vulnerability/exploit tests 
- Fix/improve the smart contracts depending on the feedback
- Round 2: try to break the fixed/improved smart contracts
- R&D for Web 2.0 static content gateways 

**Stage 3 (TBD)**

*Tokens, tests & integration experiments*

Token research taking a more proeminent role (Filecoin, Raiden, BTC relay, ETH appcoins interoperability) combined with identity and experiments on an interactive Web 2.0 version (Metamask/Light Wallets/uPort). Analyze and A/B test the most interesting token proposals to see how it affects the health of the ecosystem and behaviour of users. 

Main goals

- Understand what problems we should strive to solve with a token
- Test the most interesting ideas bubbling from the collective intelligence of the community
- Learn if a token is indeed needed and beneficial in the ecosystem
- R&D for Web 2.0 interactive version

**Stage 4 (TBD)**

*Development roadmap proposal*

Propose development roadmap for 2017 with votes counting as feedback on feature prioritization. 

Main goals

- Community driven development roadmap proposal
- Focus attention and resources on most wanted features
- Testing Web 2.0 interactive version
- Fine tuning for main network launch

**Stage 5 (TBD)**

*AKASHA v 1.0*

Many variables in the equation as it all depends on the findings and lessons learned during the previous stages. If everything goes according to plan, the AKASHA contracts will be deployed on the main net, hopefully with a working Web 2.0 version for ease of access for people not interested in running their own ETH and IPFS node.

Main goals

- Using the security and synergy of the ethereum main network ecosystem
- Enabling "real value" token transfers between readers and content creators
- Web 2.0 main net version deployed, preferably interactive
- Publish experiment-driven white paper documenting our findings
- Open the dapp to the world at large

Again, this short roadmap is *tentative* and should be taken as such. We want to involve the community as much as possible in this project and we are open to adjusting the various stages listed above (and not only) to accomodate unforeseen events or strong feedback in areas that are not covered yet. 

**More details will follow in the next couple of weeks once we start sending the invites!**

### Closing notes

In the first release(s) the dapp might showcase unstable behavior and occasional bugs. This is the tradeoff for being among the first people to experiment a standalone dapp bundling bleeding edge technologies such as Ethereum and IPFS - there is no way around it since both are still in their very early days. 

There are many moving parts involved in making this happen and there will be things that are expected to manifest unexpected behaviour. When something like this happens, please take a deep breath and remember that we want to iron out these bugs as much as you do. 

Help us to help you by opening an issue or by [getting in touch with us on Slack!](http://akasha-slack.herokuapp.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

Thank you for your patience and understanding!

See you soon. On AKASHA!
